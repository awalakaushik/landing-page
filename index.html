        <h2>Rambutan</h2>
        <p>This Ping-Pong-ball-size red fruit is indigenous to Malaysia, and has also been cultivated throughout Thailand, South Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, India and Sri Lanka. It features a thin, leathery skin covered in tiny pinkish hairs for which it is named (in Malay, rambut means hair). A relative of the lychee, it has a white or pinkish flesh on the inside that is described as juicy and sweet. It's often eaten fresh or canned, in salads and, more recently, in high-end cocktails.</p>

        <h2>Durian</h2>
        <p>This Southeast Asian delicacy is known first and foremost for its potent odor, which is said to be similar to rotting food or garbage. It's so pungent, in fact, that it's banned from certain restaurants and hotels, as the smell can linger for days. The durian tree does not bear fruit until it is 15 years old, making its prized crop very expensive—up to $50 per fruit, according to National Geographic. About the size of a volleyball, the fruit's shell is covered in short spikes, and needs to be broken open like a coconut to reach the fleshy middle, which can be eaten raw, but is also used in anything from Malaysian candy and ice cream to traditional soups.</p>

        <h2>African Cucumber</h2>
        <p>Also known as the horned melon, jelly melon, kiwano or hedged gourd, the African cucumber is a vibrant fruit, featuring a mosaic of green and yellow colors on the inside and bright orange on the outside. It originates in the Kalahari Desert—which spans from central Botswana to west central South Africa and eastern Namibia—but can now be found in California and New Zealand. The taste has been compared to cucumber and zucchini, or a mix of banana, cucumber and lemon, and it is often used for decorating platters or as an ingredient in smoothies and sundaes.</p>

        <h2>Ackee</h2>
        <p>Native to West Africa, the ackee is now mostly produced and consumed in the Caribbean, particularly in Haiti and Jamaica, where it is the national fruit. Measuring up to 4 inches in diameter, this bulbous fruit grows on the evergreen ackee tree. It has a yellow and red leathery skin and must open naturally, at least partially, revealing thick, cream-colored sections attached to three shiny black seeds, before it is removed from the tree. (An unripe ackee can be poisonous when eaten.) The nutty-flavored flesh is often parboiled in salted water or milk and then lightly fried in butter. It's also served with codfish, added to stews, or curried and eaten with rice.</p>
