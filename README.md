# Udacity Landing-Page Project


## Project Summary
The project aims to give the real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. The functionality is being used serves two purposes: to prepare for appending dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site. This project barely touches the surface of what is possible, but it does use some incredibly common events, methods, and logic.

## Building the Application
We will be building a multi-section landing page. Often times, we don’t know how much content will be added to a page through a CMS or an API. To circumvent this problem, we can dynamically add the content to the page. We will be demonstrating this with the navigation menu. Additionally, dynamically building the navigation is a great precursor to understanding the virtual DOM which is experienced when working with JavaScript frameworks.

To improve the user experience, the section actively being viewed is differentiated in some way. Additionally, when a user clicks on a navigation item, the item scrolls to the appropriate section rather than giving the default jump. This may not sound like a lot, but there are a fair amount of moving pieces that rely on each other to work.

## Learning Scope
The landing page presents the first opportunity to fully combine the skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a large project. Aside from solidifying the skills with these three technologies, we’ll discover how best to combine them in a complex application.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Open `index.html` to view the landing page with navigation links built dynamically with scroll and click events.

## Technologies

This project demonstrates the understanding of advanced JavaScript, HTML and CSS - Working with DOM, dynamically generating sections of HTML using JS.

## Credits
- Thanks to Udacity for making sure one applies the knowledge gained from the lessons
- Thanks to Chris Ferdinandi, https://gomakethings.com for providing a helper function `isInViewport(element)` to determine if an element is in Viewport.
